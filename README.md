Puzzles for Thanksgiving break y'all.


Have fun.


Basically clone this repo and each file will tell you what to do. You may need to use Repl.it, which can be done without logging in: https://repl.it/languages/python3 or if you'd like to do it while signed in sign into Repl using GitHub and go to the same link.


If you have questions text on the Slack (https://join.slack.com/t/dvgate/shared_invite/zt-ijp1fq2e-mi5WmevnbcgzzI6YefK9gQ). Follow the instructions to set up an account if you don't have one. Use the "puzzles" channel.
