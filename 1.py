# puzzle 1


# you've been set up with a test list:
mylist = ['these', 'are', 'example', 'items']


'''
make sure to enforce syntax. Use " or ' to open and then end a string, but don't mix them - pick one and stick with it. To add a quote in a string use \' or \" and if you'd like to add a line, then do this: 'This is some text\nThis is some text on a new line'
'''


# commenting methods could be used as # at any point in a line or ''' to open and then ''' to close after you put commented 
# of course, don't forget print strings: print('string').



# now, onto the challenge!
# your job is to make a loop that prints "item contains 'hello'" if the item contains the string 'hello' or print "sorry, this string does not contain hello." if it doesn't.
# a note about f strings: to print one: print(f'text and {variable}.') You'll want to use this and print what the list item has.
# you'll have to add items to the list and logic to the loop.
for x in mylist:
  if 'hello' in x:
    pass
  else:
    pass
